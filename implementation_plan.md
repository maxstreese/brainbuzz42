# BrainBuzz SPA Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a framework-agnostic approach to building BrainBuzz, a multiplayer trivia game, as a Single Page Application (SPA). The plan focuses on architecture, components, and features rather than specific technologies, allowing for flexibility in choosing frameworks and libraries during implementation.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Client-Side Architecture

- **Single Page Application (SPA)** - All game interactions happen without full page reloads
- **Component-Based Structure** - UI organized into reusable, composable components
- **Client-Side Routing** - Handle navigation between game states without server requests
- **State Management** - Centralized store for game state, player data, and questions
- **Real-Time Communication Layer** - Abstract interface for WebSocket/polling functionality

### 2. Server-Side Requirements

- **RESTful API** - For basic operations (create/join rooms, user management)
- **WebSocket Server** - For real-time game updates and player interactions
- **In-Memory or Simple Data Store** - For managing active games and questions

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Application Foundation

**Goal**: Create the core SPA structure and navigation flow between screens

#### Tasks:

1. **Set up project structure**
   - Create a modular folder structure for components, state management, services, and utilities
   - Implement basic styling approach (CSS/SASS modules, CSS-in-JS, or utility classes)

2. **Implement client-side routing**
   - Home/welcome screen
   - Game lobby (room creation/joining)
   - Active game screen
   - Results/leaderboard screen

3. **Create base components**
   - Button component
   - Input field component with validation
   - Card/container components
   - Modal/dialog component

4. **Build static page layouts**
   - Home screen with nickname input and room creation/joining
   - Game lobby showing connected players
   - Question screen with answer options
   - Score/leaderboard display

### Phase 2: State Management & Communication

**Goal**: Implement state management and real-time communication abstraction

#### Tasks:

1. **Design state structure**
   - Player state (id, nickname, score, streak)
   - Room state (id, players, game status)
   - Game state (current question, timer, scores)
   - UI state (loading states, modal visibility)

2. **Implement state management**
   - Create state store with actions/reducers or similar pattern
   - Connect components to state
   - Add methods for updating state based on game events

3. **Design real-time communication interface**
   - Create abstraction for real-time messaging
   - Define events for game actions (join room, start game, answer question)
   - Implement mock version for initial development

4. **Create service layers**
   - Room service (create/join/leave)
   - Game service (start game, submit answers)
   - Player service (update nickname, track score)

### Phase 3: Game Logic Implementation

**Goal**: Implement core game mechanics and scoring

#### Tasks:

1. **Room management**
   - Create room with unique ID
   - Join existing room with ID
   - Leave room handling
   - Host controls and permissions

2. **Game flow**
   - Start game trigger (host only)
   - Question presentation logic
   - Timer implementation
   - Answer submission and validation
   - Score calculation and updating
   - Game completion handling

3. **Scoring mechanics**
   - Basic scoring for correct answers
   - Streak bonuses
   - Real-time score updates
   - Leaderboard sorting

4. **Question management**
   - Question storage and retrieval
   - Randomization and selection logic
   - Preventing question repetition

### Phase 4: UI Implementation & Refinement

**Goal**: Create engaging, responsive UI and enhance user experience

#### Tasks:

1. **Enhance component styling**
   - Apply consistent theme and branding
   - Implement responsive layouts for all screen sizes
   - Create engaging visual design per README

2. **Add animations and transitions**
   - Page transitions between game states
   - Answer feedback animations
   - Score change indicators
   - Streak indicators (ðŸ”¥)
   - End-of-game animations

3. **Implement feedback mechanisms**
   - Instant feedback on answer correctness
   - Visual and audio cues for game events
   - Toast/notification system for game updates

4. **Accessibility considerations**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Color contrast compliance
   - Focus management

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

**Goal**: Ensure application quality and performance

#### Tasks:

1. **Unit testing**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Test state management logic
   - Test game mechanics

2. **Integration testing**
   - Test component interactions
   - Test real-time communication flows

3. **End-to-end testing**
   - Test complete game flow scenarios
   - Multi-player testing scenarios

4. **Performance optimization**
   - Bundle size analysis and reduction
   - Rendering performance improvements
   - Network request optimization
   - State update efficiency

### Phase 6: Server Integration

**Goal**: Connect to actual backend services

#### Tasks:

1. **Replace mock services with real implementations**
   - Connect to WebSocket server
   - Implement API calls for room creation/joining

2. **Handle network and state synchronization**
   - Connection status management
   - Reconnection logic
   - State reconciliation for interrupted connections

3. **Error handling**
   - Network error recovery
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages

## Component Breakdown

### Core UI Components

- **Nickname Input** - For player identification
- **Room Creation/Join** - Interface for starting/joining games
- **Player List** - Shows players in current room with scores
- **Question Display** - Shows current question text
- **Answer Options** - Multiple choice answer buttons
- **Timer Display** - Visual countdown for question time
- **Score Display** - Current player score and streak
- **Leaderboard** - Sorted list of players by score
- **Game Results** - End-of-game summary and winner display

### Service Abstractions

- **WebSocket Service** - Handles real-time communication
- **Room Service** - Manages room creation and joining
- **Game Service** - Handles game flow and question management
- **Player Service** - Manages player data and scoring

## Data Structures

### Player

```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;
  nickname: string;
  score: number;
  streak: number;
}
```

### Room

```typescript
interface Room {
  id: string;
  players: Player[];
  hostId: string;
  isGameStarted: boolean;
  currentQuestionIndex?: number;
}
```

### Question

```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswerIndex: number;
}
```

### Game State

```typescript
interface GameState {
  roomId: string | null;
  players: Player[];
  currentPlayer: Player | null;
  currentQuestion: Question | null;
  isGameStarted: boolean;
  isGameEnded: boolean;
  timeRemaining: number;
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

- **Framework Selection**: Any modern JavaScript framework supporting component-based architecture can be used (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.)
- **State Management**: Use the framework's native capabilities or third-party libraries
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets preferred, with long-polling as fallback
- **Styling Approach**: Choose based on team preferences and project requirements
- **Deployment Strategy**: Static hosting with separate API/WebSocket server

This implementation plan provides a framework-agnostic roadmap for developing BrainBuzz as a modern, engaging multiplayer SPA while maintaining flexibility for specific technology choices.
